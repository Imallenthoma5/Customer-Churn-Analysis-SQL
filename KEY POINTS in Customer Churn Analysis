1. What are the primary factors influencing customer churn? Are there any specific patterns or correlations in the data that indicate churn-prone customers? AGE GROUP IS A FACTOR. 51-70+ SHOWING HIGHER CHURN. YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHURN THAN MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. IF CUSTOMER HAS 0 DEPENDANTS, THERE IS GREATER POSSIBILITY OF CHURN. DSL IS BETTER, HAS LESSER CHURN RATE THAN FIBER OPTIC. 

2. Can we identify any demographic or behavioral characteristics that differentiate churned customers from those who continue to be active? STREAMING TV HAS LESSER CHURN AS COMPARED TO STREAMING MOVIES SUBSCRIPTION. MAYBE THIS IS A WASTE AND CAN BE ELIMINATED.

3. Are there any specific services or contract terms that contribute significantly to customer churn? Are there opportunities to modify or enhance these offerings to reduce churn? YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHURN THAN MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. SO TRY TO GET CUSTOMERS TO TAKE YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION MODEL, GIVE THEM SOME SPECIAL OFFER FOR THAT. STREAMING TV HAS LESSER CHURN AS COMPARED TO STREAMING MOVIES SUBSCRIPTION. MAYBE THIS IS A WASTE AND CAN BE ELIMINATED. AGE 51-70+ SHOWING A BIT HIGHER CHURN, SO MAYBE WE CAN TRY AND GIVE THEM SOME ELDERLY CITIZENSâ€™ OFFER. FINALLY, WE CAN GIVE OFFERS FOR DSL CONNECTION, AND TEMPT THE CUSTOMERS TAKE DSL CONNECTION RATHER THAN FIBER OPTIC, SINCE FIBER OPTIC CONNECTION SHOWS GREATER CHURN.
